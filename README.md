# Medulla

**Medulla** is a modular, event-driven C++ framework for analysis, systematic uncertainty evaluation, and plotting in LArTPC-based neutrino experiments. It is the companion analysis layer to the [SPINE reconstruction framework](https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/spine), offering a declarative configuration interface and high-performance tools for developing and applying a physics selection. The design philosophy emphasizes simplicity and portability from one experiment to another.
