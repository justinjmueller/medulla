/**
 * @file selectors.h
 * @brief Header file for the selectors used in the SPINE analysis framework.
 * @details This file contains the definitions of selectors which can be used
 * to select a single particle (by index) within an interaction. This is a
 * useful feature for reducing down a collection of particles in a final state
 * to just a single one, which allows a user to broadcast a particle-level
 * variable "upwards" to the interaction level (i.e., it can be placed in a
 * branch of a tree that is otherwise filled with interaction-level variables).

/**
 * @namespace selectors
 * @brief Namespace for organizing selectors which act on interactions.
 * @details This namespace is intended to be used for organizing selectors
 * which act on interactions. Each selector is implemented as a function
 * which takes an interaction object as an argument and returns the index
 * of the selected particle. The function should be templated on the type
 * of interaction object if the selector is intended to be used on both
 * true and reconstructed interactions.
